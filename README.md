WebScrapper

How many times you wanted to visit couple of web sites get a piece of information from them and
do something with later For example: 
Visit a stock ranking web site see how analysts rank them and check if we are in bearish or bullish market.
The sample is doing that using only 2 files but you can do it with the whole sp 500.

Or a little use more elaborate that had with this code (well it is for my wife.. :) is: 
Get the list of the newest movies, rank them according to your favorite movie ranking web site (rotten tomatoes) 
and check if our favorite streaming web has them.

Note: The main point of the share is to give an easy start for any spring/hibernate web app. 
It is just I think that also examples needs to do something.

Spending your time going over this will show you how: 
1. Working with Spring MVC using annotations 
2. Using Spring templates 
3. Using XPath to scape html DOMs 
4. Annotate objects to work with Hibernate 
5. Using the OpenSessionInViewFilter pattern 
6. Using Ajax with JQuery to send the status to the UI

Just for the terminology sake Scrapping composed is composed out or 3 phases: 
Getting the page - fetting the html, cleaning it 
Getting the XPath values 
Exporting it to the desired format and maybe sending it/storing it..

All the rest is fairly documented.
